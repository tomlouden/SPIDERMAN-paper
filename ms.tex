\subsection{Model design}\label{sec:fitting}

The model is designed so that an arbitrary brightness distribution can be used, and that the resulting phase curve and secondary eclipse lightcurves can be calculated rapidly and accurately. 

The visible disc of the planet is divided into a series of annuli, and then these in turn are separated in theta. The number of segments in each annuli are chosen so that the area of every sector is the same. This results in 1 circular segment in the center, then 3 regions in the second annuli See the schematic in figure \ref{fig:schematic}. The planet is defined to have a radius of 1. Other grid schemes could be implemented in future versions, for example, if it is decided that the information content is higher in some parts of the planet than others then the grid could be made finer in these regions.


In practice, it is found that dividing the planet into 5 radially (25 total sectors) gives results within a few percent of higher density grids, and is significantly faster.

\subsection{Performance}\label{sec:performance}

In typical usage, SPIDERMAN is capable of producing over 1000 models per second on a single core. This means that a 1 million MCMC sample can be generated in approximately a quarter of an hour.

The performance tests were carried out on a single core of an Intel Core I5-3470 Processor.

\section{The \textsc{spiderman} package}\label{sec:package}

\textsc{spiderman} is an open source project and is being actively developed on github. The code is available on PyPi, and the latest stable version can easily by installed by simply running the command 

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
> pip install spiderman-package
\end{Verbatim}

Or, to access the bleeding-edge development version from github:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
> git clone https://github.com/tomlouden/SPIDERMAN
> cd SPIDERMAN
> sudo python setup.py install
\end{Verbatim}

Full installation instructions and other information are available in the documentation, at \url{http://spiderman.readthedocs.io}

\section{Application to data}\label{sec:Observations}

As a test of the performance of the code the model was applied to a phase curve and secondary eclipse of WASP-43b taken with HST WFC3. These data had previously been published in \citet{Stevenson2014c}. However, in this paper the phase curve and the secondary eclipse are treated as seperate phenomena, when of course, they are both manifestations of the same underlying brightness distribution. Indeed, the bright dayside of the planet is the main driver of the phase curve, and is also the part occulted by the stellar disc. It is therefore more parsimonious, if at all possible, to use a model that accounts for both of these observations simultaneously. This also reduces the total number of paramters needed, which is satisfying from an information content angle.

One could argue that planetary limb darkening, among other effects, will act to decouple the secondary eclipse from the phase curve, and there are not good constraints on what to expect from the limb darkening as it requires a full atmosphere model treatment. \textsc{spiderman} does have the option to include planetary limb darkening, which would allow one to marginalise over the uncertainty in these parameters. 

In principle, constraints being placed on the limb darkening can constrain the vertical temperature profile of the planet, however this would require a full radiative transfer treatment of the planet.

WASP-43b appears to have a near isothermal profile \citep{Stevenson2014c}, which should correspon
