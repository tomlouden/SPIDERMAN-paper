abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy, which consists of measuring the wavelength-dependent absorption of starlight by a planet's atmosphere during a transit, is a powerful probe of atmospheric composition. However, the expected signal is typically orders of magnitude smaller than instrumental systematics, and the results are crucially dependent on the treatment of the latter. In this paper, we propose a new method to infer transit parameters in the presence of systematic noise using Gaussian processes, a technique widely used in the machine learning community for Bayesian regression and classification problems. Our method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of the instrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a specific dependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters, and naturally allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an example application of the method to archival NICMOS transmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter HD 189733, which goes some way towards reconciling the controversy surrounding this dataset in the literature. Finally, we provide an appendix giving a general introduction to Gaussian processes for regression, in order to encourage their application to a wider range of problems.},

abstract = {I introduce batman, a Python package for modeling exoplanet transit light curves. The batman package supports calculation of light curves for any radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law, using a new integration algorithm for models that cannot be quickly calculated analytically. The code uses C extension modules to speed up model calculation and is parallelized with OpenMP. For a typical light curve with 100 data points in transit, batman can calculate one million quadratic limb-darkened models in 30 seconds with a single 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor. The same calculation takes seven minutes using the four-parameter nonlinear limb darkening model (computed to 1 ppm accuracy). Maximum truncation error for integrated models is an input parameter that can be set as low as 0.001 ppm, ensuring that the community is prepared for the precise transit light curves we anticipate measuring with upcoming facilities. The batman package is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/lkreidberg/batman.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {Super Earths and mini Neptunes likely have a wide range of atmospheric compositions, such as H2, H2O, N2, and CO2. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets, using an idealized three-dimensional general circulation model (GCM). The bulk composition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent variables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular weight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the equatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the "jet core" region, where the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level. The zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher-molecular weight atmosphere. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will play a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere. Six possible observables exhibit trends with molecular weight in our simulations: (I) day-night temperature difference; (II) thermal phase shift; (III) root-mean-square of the wind speed; (IV) latitudinal widths of the equatorial jets; and (V) pressure of the jet core region; and (VI) maximum zonal-mean zonal jet speed. We also present analytical theories that quantitatively explain the above trends. Those observables could be used to indirectly determine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets.},

@article{Cowan2007,
abstract = {We present results from Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the mid-infrared phase variations of three short-period extrasolar planetary systems: HD 209458, HD 179949 and 51 Peg. We gathered IRAC images in multiple wavebands at eight phases of each planet's orbit. We find the uncertainty in relative photometry from one epoch to the next to be significantly larger than the photon counting error at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. We are able to place 2-sigma upper limits of only 2{\%} on the phase variations at these wavelengths. At 8 micron the epoch-to-epoch systematic uncertainty is comparable to the photon counting noise and we detect a phase function for HD 179949 which is in phase with the planet's orbit and with a relative peak-to-trough amplitude of 0.00141(33). Assuming that HD 179949b has a radius R{\_}J {\textless} R{\_}p {\textless} 1.2R{\_}J, it must recirculate less than 21{\%} of incident stellar energy to its night side at the 1-sigma level (where 50{\%} signifies full recirculation). If the planet has a small Bond albedo, it must have a mass less than 2.4 M{\_}J (1-sigma). We do not detect phase variations for the other two systems but we do place the following 2-sigma upper limits: 0.0007 for 51 Peg, and 0.0015 for HD 209458. Due to its edge-on configuration, the upper limit for HD 209458 translates, with appropriate assumptions about Bond albedo, into a lower limit on the recirculation occuring in the planet's atmosphere. HD 209458b must recirculate at least 32{\%} of incident stellar energy to its night side, at the 1-sigma level, which is consistent with other constraints on recirculation from the depth of secondary eclipse depth at 8 micron and the low optical albedo. These data indicate that different Hot Jupiter planets may experience different recirculation efficiencies.},

We develop two complementary techniques for deriving the two dimensional planet intensity: regularized slice mapping and spherical harmonic mapping. Both techniques give similar derived intensity maps for the infrared day-side flux of the planet, while the spherical harmonic method can be extended to include phase variation data which better constrain the map. The longitudinal offset of the day-side hot spot is consistent with that found in prior studies, strengthening the claim of super-rotating winds, and eliminating the possibility of phase variations being caused by stellar variability. The latitude of the hot-spot is within 10.1 deg (68{\%} confidence) of the planet's equator, confirming the predictions of general circulation models for hot Jupiters and indicative of a small planet obliquity.},

abstract = {For extrasolar planets discovered using the radial velocity method, the spectral characterization of the host star leads to a mass estimate of the star and subsequently of the orbiting planet. If the orbital velocity of the planet could be determined, the masses of both star and planet could be calculated using Newton's law of gravity, just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b. We see a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, which we conclude arises from a change in the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00 +/- 0.22M(Sun) and 0.64 +/- 0.09M(Jup) respectively. A blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal of approximately 2 km s(-1) with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0.01-0.1 mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations. The strength of the carbon monoxide signal suggests a carbon monoxide mixing ratio of (1-3) x 10(-3) in this planet's upper atmosphere.},

abstract = {Mapping distant worlds is the next frontier for exoplanet infrared photometry studies. Ultimately, constraining spatial and temporal properties of an exoplanet atmosphere will provide further insight into its physics. For tidally-locked hot Jupiters that transit and are eclipsed by their host star, the first steps are now possible.   Our aim is to constrain an exoplanet's shape, brightness distribution (BD) and system parameters from its light curve. Notably, we rely on the eclipse scanning.   We use archived Spitzer 8-{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m data of HD189733 (6 transits, 8 secondary eclipses, and a phase curve) in a global MCMC procedure for mitigating systematics. We also include HD189733's out-of-transit radial velocity measurements.   We find a 6-{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} deviation from the expected occultation of a uniformly-bright disk. This deviation emerges mainly from HD189733b's thermal pattern, not from its shape. We indicate that the correlation of the orbital eccentricity, e, and BD (uniform time offset) does also depend on the stellar density, $\backslash$rho*, and the impact parameter, b (e-b-$\backslash$rho*-BD correlation). For HD189733b, we find that relaxing the e-constraint and using more complex BDs lead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized and latitudinally-shifted hot spot. We obtain an improved constraint on the upper limit of HD189733b's orbital eccentricity, e{\textless}0.011 (95{\%}), when including the RV measurements.   Our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curves and a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. Observations of the same exoplanet at different wavelengths will improve the constraints on its system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3D map of its atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the perspective of extending our method to observations in the visible, in particular to better understand exoplanet albedos.},

abstract = {The meteorology of hot Jupiters has been characterized primarily with thermal measurements, but recent observations suggest the possibility of directly detecting the winds by observing the Doppler shift of spectral lines seen during transit. Motivated by these observations, we show how Doppler measurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. We show that the atmospheric circulation--and Doppler signature--of hot Jupiters splits into two regimes. Under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcing generates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves with the mean flow. In this regime, air along the terminator (as seen during transit) flows toward Earth in some regions and away from Earth in others, leading to a Doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshifted components. Under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermal forcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generate jets. Strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jet formation. As a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated by high-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifted Doppler signature during transit. We present state-of-the-art circulation models including nongray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift and the resulting Doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets like GJ 436b lie in the first regime, HD 189733b is transitional, while planets hotter than HD 209458b lie in the second regime. Moreover, we show how the amplitude of the Doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag in the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. If due to winds, the {\~{}}2-km/sec blueshift inferred on HD 209458b may require drag time constants as short as 10{\^{}}4-10{\^{}}6 seconds, possibly the result of Lorentz-force braking on this planet's hot dayside.},

abstract = {'Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close ({\textless}0.05 astronomical units, where 1 au is the average Sun-Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212 +/- 11 K at a wavelength of 8 mum, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16 +/- 6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.},

abstract = {We present global, three-dimensional numerical simulations of HD 189733b and HD 209458b that couple the atmospheric dynamics to a realistic representation of non-gray cloud-free radiative transfer. The model, which we call the Substellar and Planetary Atmospheric Radiation and Circulation (SPARC) model, adopts the MITgcm for the dynamics and uses the radiative model of McKay, Marley, Fortney, and collaborators for the radiation. Like earlier work with simplified forcing, our simulations develop a broad eastward equatorial jet, mean westward flow at higher latitudes, and substantial flow over the poles at low pressure. For HD 189733b, our simulations without TiO and VO opacity can explain the broad features of the observed 8 and 24-micron light curves, including the modest day-night flux variation and the fact that the planet/star flux ratio peaks before the secondary eclipse. Our simulations also provide reasonable matches to the Spitzer secondary-eclipse depths at 4.5, 5.8, 8, 16, and 24 microns and the groundbased upper limit at 2.2 microns. However, we substantially underpredict the 3.6-micron secondary-eclipse depth, suggesting that our simulations are too cold in the 0.1-1 bar region. Predicted temporal variability in secondary-eclipse depths is {\~{}}1{\%} at Spitzer bandpasses, consistent with recent observational upper limits at 8 microns. We also show that nonsynchronous rotation can significantly alter the jet structure. For HD 209458b, we include TiO and VO opacity; these simulations develop a hot ({\textgreater}2000 K) dayside stratosphere. Despite this stratosphere, we do not reproduce current Spitzer photometry of this planet. Light curves in Spitzer bandpasses show modest phase variation and satisfy the observational upper limit on day-night phase variation at 8 microns. (abridged)},

@article{Knutson2008,
abstract = {We present new Spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b in the MIPS 24 micron bandpass, spanning the same part of the planet's orbit as our previous observations in the IRAC 8 micron bandpass (Knutson et al. 2007). We find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux from the planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3{\%} of the maximum flux; this corresponds to minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/- 48 K and 1220 +/- 47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an orbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30 degrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would have enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the small amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's atmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night side at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature differences. The similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for HD 189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a fundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these two wavelengths. One-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8 micron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron, although the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. If these two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that the temperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence that the atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes.
